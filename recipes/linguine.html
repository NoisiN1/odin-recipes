        <p>This is a super fast and easy recipe. One of my favorites. Even my kids love it.</p> 
        <p>Though sometimes I use 1 1/2 pounds of noodles. Fettuccine can also be used.</p>
        <p>Tastes even better with fresh baked rolls or French bread and a garden salad.</p>
        <p>For the special occasion have a nice glass of red wine with it.</p>
